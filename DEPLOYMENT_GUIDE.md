# Vercel Deployment Guide for Multiple Disease Prediction System

## The Problem with Your Current Deployment
Your Streamlit Cloud deployment is failing due to package compatibility issues with Python 3.13:

1. **Pillow 10.2.0** - Not compatible with Python 3.13
2. **Pandas 2.1.4** - Build errors with Python 3.13  
3. **Fixed package versions** - Too restrictive for newer Python versions

## ✅ FIXED: Updated Requirements
I've updated your `requirements.txt` with compatible versions and added `.python-version` file to use Python 3.11.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Deploy Streamlit App to Streamlit Cloud (Recommended) - NOW FIXED!

**What I Fixed:**
- ✅ Updated `requirements.txt` with flexible, compatible versions
- ✅ Added `.python-version` file to use Python 3.11 
- ✅ Created `requirements-fixed.txt` as backup with specific working versions

**Steps to Deploy:**
1. **Push the updated files to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix dependencies for Streamlit Cloud deployment"
   git push
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Streamlit Cloud:**
   - Go to your app dashboard on [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
   - Click "Reboot app" or redeploy
   - The build should now succeed!

**If still having issues, try the backup requirements:**
- Rename `requirements-fixed.txt` to `requirements.txt`
- Push to GitHub again

### Option 2: Use the Flask Version for Vercel (Alternative)

I've created a simplified Flask version (`app.py`) that can work with Vercel:

1. **Setup:**
   - Rename `requirements-flask.txt` to `requirements.txt` (for Flask deployment)
   - Use the `app.py` file instead of the Streamlit version
   - Make sure `vercel.json` is configured properly

2. **Deploy to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   # Install Vercel CLI
   npm i -g vercel
   
   # Login to Vercel
   vercel login
   
   # Deploy
   vercel --prod
   ```

3. **Limitations of Flask Version:**
   - Simplified UI compared to Streamlit
   - Only basic prediction functionality
   - No advanced visualizations

### Option 3: Deploy to Other Platforms

**Heroku (Good for Streamlit):**
- Create a `Procfile`: `web: streamlit run multiplediseaseprediction.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0`
- Deploy using Heroku CLI

**Railway (Good for Streamlit):**
- Connect your GitHub repo
- No additional configuration needed

**Render (Good for Streamlit):**
- Connect your GitHub repo
- Set build command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Set start command: `streamlit run multiplediseaseprediction.py --server.port=$PORT --server.address=0.0.0.0`

## Files Created for Vercel Option:

1. **`app.py`** - Flask version of your application
2. **`templates/index.html`** - Web interface for Flask app
3. **`vercel.json`** - Vercel configuration
4. **`requirements-flask.txt`** - Python dependencies for Flask

## Recommendation

**Use Streamlit Cloud** for the best experience because:
- ✅ No code changes needed
- ✅ Keeps all your existing features
- ✅ Free hosting
- ✅ Easy deployment
- ✅ Automatic updates from GitHub

The Flask version is a backup option if you specifically need to use Vercel, but you'll lose many features from your original Streamlit app.

## Next Steps

1. Choose your preferred deployment option
2. If using Streamlit Cloud: Push to GitHub and deploy
3. If using Vercel: Test the Flask version locally first
4. Update any file paths or configurations as needed

Let me know which option you'd like to proceed with!
